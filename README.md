Hello! I'm Aaron, a skilled product engineer dedicated to delivering value to customers. I prioritise addressing real-world problems over simply adding features and rely on user feedback to fine-tune my design and development strategies.

My expertise spans engineering and design, allowing me to approach problems with fresh ideas through continuous learning and growth. I specialise in front-end technologies like TypeScript, React, and Tailwind while also handling back-end tasks when needed. My eye for design helps me collaborate seamlessly with designers, prototyping and experimenting with new ideas both in Figma and in code and integrating these into development work.

Testing and feedback are core to my process. I use tools like Playwright and Vitest to ensure the reliability of my code, while system design principles like SOLID and Domain-Driven Design help me build flexible systems designed for change. I'm a big fan of shipping early and often to make sure my work aligns with customer needs.

I'm currently leading design engineering efforts for Superwave (https://www.superwave.com), a product that empowers community managers to connect with members more effectively. My responsibilities include delivering new features, designing, building, and documenting design systems, and mentoring team members in design systems and React refactoring patterns, enhancing team effectiveness and code quality.
