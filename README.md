Hello! My name is Aaron, and I'm an experienced product engineer passionate about creating solutions that positively impact people's lives. I have a diverse skill set, including design and engineering, and I'm always learning and coming up with new ideas to improve my projects.

At the core of everything I do is a focus on delivering value to users. I prioritise solving real problems over just adding features and rely on user feedback to validate my assumptions during the design and development process.

As a front-end engineer, I specialise in design systems using technologies like TypeScript, React, Tailwind, and XState. While my primary focus is on front-end development, I can handle some back-end tasks when necessary. In addition to my technical expertise, I have a strong passion for design and love using Figma to prototype and bring new ideas to life.

Testing is a crucial aspect of my work, and I rely on tools like Cypress and Jest to ensure code quality. Alongside this, I prioritise system design, incorporating practices like SOLID and Domain-Driven Design to build flexible systems that can easily adapt to change. Trunk-based development and feature flags also play a key role in my process, allowing me to gather feedback quickly and make improvements.

In my current role at Ticketmaster, I lead a team responsible for rearchitecting and consolidating payment systems. My responsibilities include designing and building products, creating a design system with Tailwind and Storybook, mentoring team members, and introducing and maintaining processes like Agile, Product Design, Test Driven Development, and Continuous Deployment.
