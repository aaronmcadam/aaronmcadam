Hello! I'm Aaron, a skilled product engineer with a passion for developing solutions that make a positive impact on people's lives. My diverse expertise spans design and engineering, and I'm committed to constant learning and growth.

The driving force behind my work is delivering value to users. I prioritise addressing real-world problems over simply adding features and rely on user feedback to fine-tune my design and development strategies.

As a front-end engineer, I excel in creating design systems using technologies such as TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS. While my primary focus is on front-end development, I'm also capable of handling back-end tasks when necessary. My technical abilities are enhanced by my enthusiasm for design, and I love using Figma to prototype and experiment with new ideas.

Testing and feedback are integral to my work. I use tools like Playwright and Jest to ensure the reliability of my code. Meanwhile, sound system design principles like SOLID and Domain-Driven Design enable me to build adaptable and flexible systems. I'm a fan of shipping early and frequently to ensure I'm on the right track.

Currently, I lead a team at Ticketmaster that concentrates on rearchitecting and streamlining payment systems, effectively creating a Stripe equivalent for Ticketmaster. My responsibilities span from designing and building products to mentoring team members and implementing and maintaining processes like Agile, Product Design, Test Driven Development, and Continuous Deployment.
