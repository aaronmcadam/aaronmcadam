> Crafting delightful products with clean code

Hi, I’m Aaron, and I’m passionate about building great products. I care as much about typography as I do about TypeScript—my skills stretch across design and engineering. I’m always trying to find ways to impact the businesses I work for by constantly learning new things.

While I think code quality is essential, I focus on delivering value to users above all else—I value solving problems instead of simply building features. I like to get constant feedback from real users to validate any assumptions made during design and development.
