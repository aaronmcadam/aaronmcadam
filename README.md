Hello! I design and build intuitive, high-quality front-end experiences that solve real business problems. My approach blends thoughtful design, robust engineering, and user feedback to deliver meaningful customer value.

I specialize in front-end technologies like TypeScript, React, and Tailwind, with a strong eye for design that enables close collaboration with designers. I prototype in Figma and rapidly iterate in code to refine ideas.

Quality and maintainability drive my work. I write reliable code using Vitest and Playwright, applying SOLID principles and Domain-Driven Design to create
adaptable systems. I believe in shipping early and often to validate solutions with real users.

At Buyapowa, I enhance front-end architecture, build scalable UI components, and refine our design system to improve developer efficiency and user experience. I
also mentor team members in React best practices, ensuring code quality and maintainability across projects.
