Hi, I’m Aaron — a Senior Front-End Engineer with a strong focus on design-engineering and product thinking. I specialise in building intuitive, scalable, and beautifully crafted web experiences that solve real business problems.

I work at the intersection of design and engineering. I’m fluent in front-end technologies like TypeScript, React, and Tailwind, and I care deeply about clean architecture, maintainable systems, and thoughtful UI design. I prototype in Figma and move quickly to production-ready code, collaborating closely with designers and product teams.

My approach is shaped by real-world product delivery: I prioritise quality, simplicity, and fast feedback loops. I write reliable, testable code using Vitest and Playwright, and apply principles like SOLID and Domain-Driven Design to build systems that last.

Above all, I believe in building products that people actually want to use — shipping early, learning fast, and refining through real user feedback.
